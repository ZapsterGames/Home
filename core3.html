   September 20th 2020
The gaslighting and toxic friendships are over. Iâ€™m tired of being left out and being excluded from my best friends.

   You were the cause of this message. Yes I know my mistakes and I tried to fix them. 
You turned the group, I believe your the reason that everything went to shit with the group.

<br><br>

   The words you said to me at the softball game,
A - "Yeah I haven't been told stuff recently, I've been left out"
C - "Oh I know why, But I can't tell you so suffer"
  I later left without saying anything.

   You did nothing wrong. You might be wondering why you are included in the Core 3 file. But I think it's obvious why.
You can figure it out.

   Your name was going to be spelled out. You betrayed me the most. We went through everything together. 
However you didn't hesitate to mock me, even gaslight me. You just stopped caring one day. 


I had more hope for you. I thought you were better than this.
